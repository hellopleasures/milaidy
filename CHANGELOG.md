## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Plugin resolution and NODE_PATH (doc):** `docs/plugin-resolution-and-node-path.md` explains why we set `NODE_PATH` in three places so dynamic plugin imports resolve from CLI, desktop dev, and direct eliza load. **Why:** Prevents "Cannot find module '@elizaos/plugin-...'" when entry is under `dist/` or cwd is a subdir.
- **Electron startup resilience:** The desktop app now keeps the API server running when the agent runtime fails to load (e.g. missing native module like `onnxruntime_binding.node`). **Why:** Without this, a single load failure would throw, the outer catch would tear down the API server, and the renderer would get no port and show only "Failed to fetch" with no error message. Keeping the server up and setting `state: "error"` with port preserved lets the UI connect and show "Agent unavailable: …" with the actual error. See `docs/electron-startup.md` and WHY comments in `apps/app/electron/src/native/agent.ts` — do not remove the try/catch and `.catch()` guards as "excess" exception handling.
- **Regression tests for startup resilience:** `apps/app/test/electron-ui/electron-startup-failure.e2e.spec.ts` now has two tests: (1) failed runtime keeps API server alive and recovery on retry, (2) failed `eliza.js` load (e.g. missing native binding) preserves port and no server teardown. **Why:** A failing test is strictly stronger than documentation for preventing regressions; if someone removes the guards, CI fails.

### Changed

- **Coding agent is core, not optional:** `@elizaos/plugin-coding-agent` remains in `CORE_PLUGINS` so it is always auto-loaded. **Why:** Required for PTY/coding flows; optional would mean it is not in the default load set.
- **NODE_PATH for plugin resolution:** `scripts/run-node.mjs` sets `NODE_PATH` for the spawned child so `dist/eliza.js` can resolve `@elizaos/*`. `src/runtime/eliza.ts` prepends repo root `node_modules` on load when not already set (dedupe). Electron: packaged uses ASAR `node_modules`; dev walks up from `__dirname` to find monorepo root (no fixed depth). All call `Module._initPaths()` so Node re-reads NODE_PATH. **Why:** Dynamic `import("@elizaos/plugin-...")` only works when Node knows where to look; see `docs/plugin-resolution-and-node-path.md`.
- **CI / Mac binary build:** Plugin and dependency copy for the Electron bundle is now **derived automatically** from each copied `@elizaos` package's `package.json` dependencies (see `scripts/copy-electron-plugins-and-deps.mjs`). **Why:** A curated list was a maintenance burden and caused silent failures when new plugin runtime deps were added. Walking the dependency graph ensures we copy everything plugins need; we skip known dev/renderer-only packages (e.g. typescript, lucide-react) to avoid bloat. macOS x64 builds run root and Electron installs under `arch -x86_64` so native modules get x64 binaries on Intel Macs. Whisper universal binary is built in release; electron test jobs no longer use `continue-on-error` on every step; Bun install cache and `verify-build.sh` arch detection added.

### Fixed

- **Intel Mac desktop app:** Packaged DMG could fail with "Cannot find module .../darwin/x64/onnxruntime_binding.node" because CI runs on arm64 runners and was shipping arm64 native binaries. **Why:** Native Node addons (e.g. onnxruntime-node) are built for the install host's arch; installing and building under `arch -x86_64` (Rosetta) produces x64 `.node` files so the Intel DMG works.
- **Electron agent startup:** If `eliza.js` failed to load (e.g. due to the above), the whole startup threw and the outer catch closed the API server. **Why:** We now isolate failures (`.catch()` on eliza import, try/catch around `startEliza()`), keep the API server up, and set `state: "error"` with port preserved so the renderer can display the error instead of "Failed to fetch".
- **Plugin resolution (`@elizaos/plugin-coding-agent` and others):** Dynamic `import("@elizaos/plugin-*")` from `dist/eliza.js` or `milady-dist/eliza.js` failed with "Cannot find module" because Node's resolution did not reach repo root `node_modules`. **Why:** We set `NODE_PATH` in three places (eliza.ts on load, run-node.mjs for the CLI child, Electron agent for dev/packaged); see `docs/plugin-resolution-and-node-path.md`.
- **Bun + `@elizaos/plugin-coding-agent`:** Under `bun run dev`, the plugin failed to load with "Cannot find module … from …/src/runtime/eliza.ts" even though the package was installed. **Why:** The published npm package has `exports["."].bun = "./src/index.ts"`; that path exists only in the upstream dev workspace, not in the tarball. Bun's resolver picks the `"bun"` condition first and does not fall back to `"import"` when the file is missing. We patch the package's `package.json` in `scripts/patch-deps.mjs` (postinstall) to remove the dead `bun`/`default` conditions so Bun resolves via `"import"` → `./dist/index.js`. See "Bun and published package exports" in `docs/plugin-resolution-and-node-path.md`.
